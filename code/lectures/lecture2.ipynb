    "# I. Computer Architecture and Execution of a Program\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are two different classes of programming languages based on how programs written in these languages are executed: *compiled* and *interpreted*. Before we can discuss this significance of these two classifications, you will need some background on *computer architecture*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer architecture describes the different operational components of a computer (hardware), the instructions that the computer executes (software), interaction with its environment (input/output), and how they interrelate. In order to keep things simple, we will focus on four components of a computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Processor Unit* (hardware): the *processor* executes the instructions of a program and understands a \"low-level\" set of instructions called *machine code*. Modern computers typically have multiple processors (\"cores\") which can operate independent of each other but share common infrastructure. They are located on the same piece of hardware which is referred to as the *central processing unit*. \n",
    "* *Input/Output Devices* (hardware): these devices should be familiar in that they are what we use to interact with a computer. The keyboard, mouse, microphone, camera, etc are all input devices. The monitor and speakers are all output devices.\n",
    "* *Memory* (hardware): a computer needs to store programs in order to function, which is a more complicated task than you might imagine. An engineering problem exists in that there is a competition between the capacity (amount of information stored), throughput (rate at which data can be accessed/stored), and latency (delay between information requests). As a result of this there exists a hierarchy of memory devices that the CPU must interact with; we will discuss this soon. \n",
    "* *Operating System and Applications* (software): a computer needs instructions in order to perform useful work. These are grouped into three types of programs:\n",
    "    * *Firmware*: this is the first program loaded by the computer on start-up. It initializes all of the hardware, performs tests to ensure they function properly, and then the operating system.\n",
    "    * *Operating System*: this program performs many different tasks and services that are commonly used in different applications (next item). The OS also provides a layer of *abstraction* between the hardware and other programs.\n",
    "    * *Applications*: applications are what we typically refer to as programs; they are typically OS-specific and perform a focused task.\n",
    "    \n",
    "![alt text](files/images/lecture2/lecture2-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we focus on developing programs that are classified as applications. Focusing on them, we may further classify applications based upon the type of program language that they are written in: compiled or interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Compiled* programming languages use a special program called a *compiler* to translate source code into machine code. This machine code is then executed by the OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Interpreted* programming languages use a special program called an *interpreter* to interpret and execute program statements on the CPU. Thus the interpreter is an additional layer of abstraction above the OS in this scenario. What does this imply about the implementation of the interpreter? \n",
    "\n",
    "Given our discussion about low- versus high-level programming languages in the previous lecture, one might assume that this is directly related to whether or not the programming language is compiled or interpreted. While this is definitely the predominant trend, the true distinction between low- and high-level languages is that the former exposes much of the details of the underlying computer architecture while the latter uses abstraction to hide these detailed from the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Language (interpreted, high-level):\n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time;\n",
    "\n",
    "localtime = time.asctime( time.localtime(time.time()) )\n",
    "print(\"Local current time :\", localtime)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "C Language (compiled, low-level):\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include <time.h>\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>\n",
    "     \n",
    "#define SIZE 256\n",
    "     \n",
    "int main (void)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    char buffer[SIZE];\n",
    "    time_t curtime;\n",
    "    struct tm *loctime;\n",
    "     \n",
    "    curtime = time (NULL);\n",
    "    loctime = localtime (&curtime);\n",
    "     \n",
    "    fputs (asctime (loctime), stdout);\n",
    "     \n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, interpreted programming languages enabled two different usage modes: standalone and interactive. At the end of the lecture we will try both, but for now continue to follow along in this special environment."

    "# Overview of Interactive Lecture Notes (iPython Notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "iPython Notebook is a web-based computational interpreter. It allows us to combine code editing and execution, text, mathematics and plots, and other forms of media (i.e. images, videos) all in one document. Each notebook is saved to a computer as an .ipynb file and viewed in a web browser as a static web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using iPython as interactive lecture notes to make your learning more engaging. You can follow along in these notebooks when listening to video lectures or read them separately. Each notebook corresponds to a video lecture and consists of text explaining concepts, as well as regions of unexecuted code. As you read or follow along, try to predict what the result of running the code will be. Try to understand the code, and then run the code to see if your prediction was right. You can also add text to the notebooks if you wish to add your own notes. You can also add your own code and execute it to see what the results will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the time to to explore iPython Notebook environment and get used to it. The more familiar you become with it, the more you can get out of it as a way to organize your course notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### iPython Dashboard\n",
    "Once we launch iPython Notebook from the terminal, a web browser page is launched. The first page we're directed to is the iPython Dashboard. This is where we find all of the notebooks in our current directory listed. At the top of the list, you will see where on your machine those files are located: the current directory from which you launched iPython Notebook. To open a notebook, click on its name. The selected notebook will open in a new tab. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you close a notebook, make sure to save it, either by pressing Ctrl + S or clicking the save icon in the top left corner of the toolbar in your notebook. Once you have saved, close the notebook tab. In the iPython Dashboard, next to the notebook you've just closed, click Shut Down.\n",
    "\n",
    "To shut down the iPython Notebook server, first close the iPython Dashboard tab. In the terminal, press Ctrl + C. When you are asked if you want to shut down the notebook server, press Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Structure: Cells\n",
    "A notebook consists of a sequence of cells, which are text input fields that can be executed right in the web browser. We add cells by clicking Insert > Insert Cell Above/Below in the menu bar or click the up/down __circular__ arrow icons in the toolbar to insert a cell above or below the current cell. If we want to move the cell once it's created, click the __non-circular__ up/down arrow icons in the toolbar. To remove a cell, in the menu bar click Edit > Delete Cell while the cell is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input of the cell can be executed either by pressing Shift + Enter on the keyboard, clicking the \"Play\" icon in the toolbar, or in the clicking Cell > Run in the menu bar. The way in which the contents of the cell are executed depends on the type of cell. When you have a cell selected, you can change the type in the dropdown menu in the toolbar. There are 4 different cell types:\n",
    "*    __Python Code Cells:__ This is the default cell type once we create any cell. You can edit and write Python code in these cells and executing them runs the code. The output (i.e. result of the execution of the cell) is shown in a cell below the input cell. You can hide these output cells by clicking Cell > All Output > Clear.\n",
    "*    __Raw Text Cells:__ These cells allow you to enter plain text into the notebook. iPython Notebook does not execute these files, so what is typed as input is the exact same as the output that is shown once we \"run\" the cell.\n",
    "*    __Heading Cells:__ You can use these cells to organize your notes with headings. There are 6 levels of headings with Heading 1 being the highest and Heading 6 being the lowest. You simply select the level of heading, enter your text, and run the cell and iPython Notebook will format it for you.\n",
    "*    __Markdown Cells:__ This cell type allows you to edit the notebook with *rich text*. Rich text supports text formatting, such as bold, italics, and underlining, as well as different fonts and font sizes. In iPython Notebook, this is accomplished using the language *Markdown*. To see what Markdown looks like, double click on one of the text cells (this cell is a Markdown cell). When you execute the cell, you see all of the formatting. You probably won't be using this type of cell.\n"

Most compiled languages can represent integers only up to a certain magnitude, above which \"overflow\" occurs. With floating point numbers, which approximate the set of real numbers, there are both magnitude and precision tolerances involved."

The value that the interpreter displays is the closest value to 2/3 that can be represented given the amount of memory that is allocated to a `float` in Python. We will learn of numerical libraries that allow us to increase (or decrease) the memory allocated to each value later in the class. Next semester in NE113, you will learn the exact expression used to represent `float`'s, but that is too advanced for this course."

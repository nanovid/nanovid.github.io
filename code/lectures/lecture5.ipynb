    "Mathematicians create functions, for convenience, to represent frequently used calculations and operations. Programmers also use such a paradigm, but allow functions to represent anything from calculations (arithmetic, etc) to complex operations (sorting data, displaying text on-screen, sending data over the internet, etc.). In this lecture we will learn how functions are used in Python, how to use existing \"built-in\" functions, and how to create our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, functions require input (expressions) which are called function *arguments* and \"return\" *output*. In general, there are two methods for using a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assigning function output to a variable name:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function_output = function_name(argument1, argument2,...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Ignoring function output: \n",
    "```\n",
    "function_name(argument1, argument2,...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For functions that represent mathematical expressions, we will typically want to store and use the output, but for many other cases the function output is either irrelevant or trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a set of functions that are frequently used by default; these are called *built-in* functions. For example, the function `abs()` evaluates the absolute value of a variable and thus requires one numeric argument and returns a numeric output (of the same type)."

    "|`min(arg1,arg2,...)`     |Returns the smallest item the smallest of two or more arguments.|\n",
    "|`divmod(a, b)`           |Takes two numbers as arguments and returns a pair of numbers consisting of their quotient and remainder when using long division: `(a // b, a % b)`.|\n",
    "|`int(x=0)`               |Converts a number or string x to an integer, or return 0 if no arguments are given. If the argument is a floating point, the conversion truncates towards zero.|\n",
    "|`pow(x, y[, z])`         |Returns `x` to the power `y`. If `z` is present, return `x` to the power `y`, modulo `z` (computed more efficiently than `pow(x, y) % z`). The two-argument form `pow(x, y)` is equivalent to using the power operator: `x**y`.|\n",
    "|`float([x])`             |Converts a string or a number to floating point. If the argument is a string, it must contain a possibly signed decimal or floating point number. The argument may also be [+/-]nan<sup>1</sup> or [+/-]inf<sup>2</sup>. If no argument is given, returns 0.0.|\n",
    "|`type(object)`           |Returns the type of an object. The return value is a `type` object.|\n",
    "|`complex([real[,imag]])` |Creates a complex number with the value `real + imag*j` or converts a string or number to a complex number. If the first parameter is a string, it will be interpreted as a complex number and the function must be called without a second parameter. The second parameter can never be a string. Each argument may be any numeric type (including complex). If `imag` is omitted, it defaults to zero and the function serves as a numeric conversion function like `int()`, `long()` and `float()`. If both arguments are omitted, returns `0j`.|\n",
    "|`max(arg1,arg2,...)`     |Returns the largest of two or more arguments.|\n",
    "|`round(number[,ndigits])`|Returns the floating point value number rounded to `ndigits` digits after the decimal point. If `ndigits` is omitted, it defaults to zero. The result is a floating point number. Values are rounded to the closest multiple of 10 to the power minus `ndigits`; if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done away from `0`.|\n",

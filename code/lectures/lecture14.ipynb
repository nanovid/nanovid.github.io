    "# Designing algorithms from the \"top down\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of the previous lecture content you were taught the basic syntax and formalisms for programming in Python. In this chapter we will focus putting these concepts together through problem-solving. Typically when one is faced with solving the same or similar problems repeatedly, it is best-practice to develop an *algorithm* for solving these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is \"a set of steps that are followed in order to solve a mathematical problem or to complete a computer process.\" Note that the definition does not mention anything about programming or a specific programming language. This is because an algorithm in its most general form results directly from a human thought process and is later \"translated\" into a specific programming language. Motivated by this observation, in this chapter we will learn (by example!) a method for developing an algorithm and implementing it in Python (or C, or Julia, or \\<insert programming language\\>) from the \"top down\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Top-down\" algorithm development is very intuitive but, ironically, scientists and engineers typically employ a more ad hoc \"code first, think later\" method. The top-down method involves first designing the algorithm in the most natural language for a human, human language. Try to use your first language and completely remove any thoughts of Python syntax or even computer architecture from your mind. The steps or algorithm (!) for my method for top-down algorithm development are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write, in plain language, how you would naturally solve the problem in a series of steps.\n",
    "2. Create a template for your program by inserting these human language steps as a series of code comments.\n",
    "3. Develop a set of particular examples of your problem.\n",
    "4. Sequentially implement each of the human language steps in Python (or whichever programming language your choose), adding sufficient comments when appropriate.\n",
    "5. Test that your code functions as expected using the examples from the previous step and correct it if needed. Try to think of any special cases and implement additional code to handle them, if you original design was incomplete.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate this method using a relatively simple example problem, finding the smallest values in a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Searching for the Smallest Values\n",
    "\n",
    "This seemingly simple example adds an additional layer of complexity to our algorithm development method. What should you do if you can think of multiple different algorithms for solving the same problem? We will rigorously answer that in the next section, but for now we will simply use the top-down method for each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustrative problem involves finding the indices of the smallest items in a list or other ordered collection. First we will do this for the simple problem of finding the index of the smallest value. Then we will increase the complexity of the problem and find the indices of the smallest and second smallest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use hypothetical data representing the number of humpback whales sighted off the coast of British Columbia over the past ten years:\n",
    "\n",
    "809    834    477    478    307    122    96    102    324    476\n",
    "\n",
    "order from oldest to most recent. The first problem is a bit too simple for an actual full-blown top-down design process, but is a good warm up to the types of existing Python functionality we can employ to solve the problem, "

    "First of all, you will not simply learn \"programming\" in this course. Based upon common interpretations of what the act of programming is, you could learn this on your own without any significant guidance. The same is the case for wood carving - anyone can pick-up tools and proceed to carve wood, but what will be the result of this? Depending on one's training the result could be a beautiful sculpture or a functional piece of furniture (or a combination of both).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course you will learn basic concepts of Computer Science, one of which is programming using [Python](http://www.python.org). A more general concept which you will learn indirectly is [computational thinking](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wing/www/publications/Wing06.pdf) which is guided by the following principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Conceptualization* - using multiple levels of abstraction in order to solve a complex problem.\n",
    "* *Natural thought* - solve problems in a natural (human) way before programming.\n",
    "* *Everyone, everywhere* - apply computational thinking to broadly, not just to problems that are conducive to be solved using a computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "###Programs and Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful analogy with which to define the concept of a *computer program* is with something you do everyday -- give directions! When you communicate (written, verbal, etc) a set of instructions to someone, you have created a *program*. Your peer *executes* this program by following the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three key attributes of a program:\n",
    "1. They are created using a set of basic operations (left, right, straight) to form individual instructions  (\"Turn left onto Weber St.\", \"Proceed straight for five miles.\", etc.).\n",
    "2. They are sequential, that is, the order in which the instructions are executed is significant.\n",
    "3. They are communicated using a language which is understandable to those who execute the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to language intended for human/human communication (including programming), *programming languages* refer specifically to languages intended for humans to generate programs which may be executed by a computer. There are many different types of programming languages which are useful for generating different types of programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For general engineering use, we typically use *high-level* programming languages, as opposed to low-level ones. We will learn the difference soon, but an example should provide a general idea of the difference. Here is sample code that prints the current time in Python (high-level):\n",
    "```python    \n",
    "    #!/usr/bin/python\n",
    "    import time\n",
    "\n",
    "    localtime = time.asctime( time.localtime(time.time()) )\n",
    "    print \"Local current time :\", localtime\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a program that does the same thing in C (low-level):\n",
    "```C\n",
    "     #include <time.h>\n",
    "     #include <stdio.h>\n",
    "     \n",
    "     #define SIZE 256\n",
    "     \n",
    "     int main (void)\n",
    "     {\n",
    "       char buffer[SIZE];\n",
    "       time_t curtime;\n",
    "       struct tm *loctime;\n",

    "\n",
    "What differences can you identify? Which would you prefer to use for solving engineering problems? The answer might seem obvious and directly correlate to the number of parentheses (), brackets [], and braces {} within each code block. We will shortly learn that the answer is not so obvious; each type of programming language has advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point the concepts of a *program* and a *programming language* should be clear. Throughout this course and for the rest of your career, you will frequently be creating programs that use a simple set of instructions to do complex tasks. You will find that all programming languages all have in common sets of instructions that fall into these three classifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arithmetic - instructions for programming mathematical expressions.\n",
    "2. Iterators - instructions for repeating a subroutine (\"sub-program\").\n",
    "3. Conditionals - instructions for executing various subroutines depending on a condition (e.g., if *value* is less than one, execute a special subroutine).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will focus on the [Python programming language](http://www.python.org) for a many reasons including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python has very clear, readable syntax\n",
    "2. It has \"natural\" expression of procedural code\n",
    "3. It has extensive standard libraries and third party modules for virtually every task\n",
    "4. It allows extensions and modules easily written in C, C++ and easy incorporation of FORTRAN routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an excellent programming language for both teaching and everyday programming. You will find it much easier to learn another programming language once you know the fundamentals of Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"bug\" in a program refers to an error in its code which causes unexpected behaviour. Execution of programs with *bugs* can result in any of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* an abrupt \"crash\" or termination of your program.\n",
    "* an incorrect result (2+2=5).\n",
    "* a correct result!\n",
    "\n",
    "Many bugs are very obvious (you will notice if your program crashes each time you run it), but some bugs are more subtle, perhaps only causing problems under very specific conditions. These bugs are more insidious, since they can lurk undetected for long periods of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will inevitably introduce bugs into your code, so you will learn later in the course how to prevent (design), identify (testing), and fix them when they occur."

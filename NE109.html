        If I am being honest, I have no idea what I can even put up for this
        class. It is not meant to be difficult and Dr. Howard Sui has made it so
        that it is not. Simply pay attention in class, follow his directions and
        there is no way you should not get atleast a 50 in this class. Good luck
        with this one, I am certain you are all competent enough to handle his
        one yourselves.

      Here is a something funny...the "moon" for Pluto is named Charon, and is
      nearly the size of Pluto itself! Some consider Charon to be a double dwarf
      planet, because it is a planet...that revolves around a dwarf planet!

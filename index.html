This website was made to help future nanotechnology engineering students by providing them if course notes, practice material and their respective solutions, and practice lab assignments. This is not meant to be a place to plagiarize from, as you will get caught for sure. This website was made over the winter break and we will be updating it periodically. It is not finished, but it is being worked on. Not al the scheduled files have been uploaded yet as we must restrict access to waterloo emails only. We appreciate your support and hope you find the experience enjoyable. P.S. the website is best when view in 90-100% zoom, depending on your browser, and screen aspect ratio.
